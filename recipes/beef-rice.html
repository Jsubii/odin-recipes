        <h2>Beef Over Curry-Spiced Rice with Creamy Cilantro Sauce</h2>
          <p>Served over a bed of fragrant, vadouvan-seasoned rice, our beef and carrots also get dynamic flavor from the spicy, sweet, and savory Indian tomato chutney they cook with in the pan. To bring it all together, weâ€™re finishing the dish with a drizzle of bright, creamy cilantro sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>10 oz Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Jasmine Rice</li>
        <li>6 oz Carrots</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Sour Cream</li>
        <li>2 tbsps Savory Tomato Chutney</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Cilantro Sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsps Vadouvan Curry Powder</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <h4>Cook the Rice:</h4>
        <li>In a small pot, combine the rice, half the curry powder (you will have extra), a big pinch of salt, and 1 cup of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, without stirring, 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork.</li>
        <h4>Prepare the Ingredients:</h4>
        <li>Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; halve lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. Quarter the lime.</li>
        <h4>Cook the Beef & Carrots:</h4>
        <li>In a large pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the beef and sliced carrots; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally and breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 6 to 7 minutes, or until the beef is lightly browned and the carrots are slightly softened. Carefully drain off and discard any excess oil. Add the tomato chutney and 2 tablespoons of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the beef is cooked through and the carrots are softened. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
        <h4>Make the Sauce & Serve your dish:</h4>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the sour cream, cilantro sauce, and the juice of 2 lime wedges. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the cooked rice topped with the cooked beef and carrots and sauce. Serve the remaining lime wedges on the side.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
