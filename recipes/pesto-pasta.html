        <h2>Pesto Pasta with Fresh Tomatoes & Parmesean Cheese</h2>
          <p>Light and fresh wines are the perfect backup singers for meals packed with herbal elements such as pesto. These wines have subtle fruit and light herb flavors that will add a little zing to your meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>10 oz Hot Italian Pork Sausage</li>
        <li>1/2 lb Fresh Basil Fettuccine Pasta</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Basil Pesto</li>
        <li>4 oz Grape Tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 Scallions</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Crushed Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>1 Zucchini</li>
        <li>1 oz Sliced Roasted Red Peppers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Grated Parmesean Cheese</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Mascarpone Cheese</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <h4>Prepare the Ingredients:</h4>
        <li>Remove the pasta from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Halve the zucchini lengthwise, then thinly slice crosswise. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Halve the tomatoes; place in a bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat. Roughly chop the peppers.</li>
        <h4>Cook the Sausage:</h4>
        <li>In a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sausage. Cook, stirring frequently and breaking the meat apart with a spoon, 7 to 9 minutes, or until browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a bowl. Cover with foil to keep warm.</li>
        <h4>Cook the Zucchini:</h4>
        <li>In the pan of reserved fond, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the sliced zucchini in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the sliced white bottoms of the scallions and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until softened and combined. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
        <h4>Cook the Pasta:</h4>
        <li>Meanwhile, using your hands, carefully separate the strands of pasta. Add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Turn off the heat. Reserving 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain thoroughly and return to the pot.</li>
        <h4>Finish the Pasta & Serve your Dish:</h4>
        <li>To the pot of cooked pasta, add the seasoned tomatoes, cooked sausage, cooked zucchini, chopped peppers, pesto, mascarpone, and half the reserved pasta cooking water. Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until combined and the pasta is coated (if necessary, gradually add the remaining cooking water to ensure the pasta is thoroughly coated). Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the finished pasta garnished with the parmesan and sliced green tops of the scallions.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
