    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Pasture-Raised Egg</li>
        <li>2 oz Salted Butter</li>
        <li>5 Tbsps Light Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp Warming Spices (Cinnamon, Ginger, Cardamom & Allspice)</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <h4>Make the Dough:</h4>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large bowl in the microwave (or melt in a small pot on the stove, then transfer to a large bowl). Add the brown sugar, all but 1 tablespoon of the granulated sugar, and egg; whisk to thoroughly combine. Add the flour and 1/2 teaspoon of the baking powder (you will have extra). Using a spatula, gently mix just until incorporated (be careful not to overmix). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer to an airtight container. Refrigerate 1 hour, or until firm. </li>
        <h4>Form & Roll the Cookies:</h4>
        <li>Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 375°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. In a small bowl, combine the remaining granulated sugar and warming spices. Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the dough into your hands; roll into a ball, then transfer to the bowl of spiced sugar. Toss to thoroughly coat. Transfer to the sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining dough, evenly spacing out the cookies on the sheet pan. </li>
        <h4>Bake the Cookies & Serve your Dish:</h4>
        <li>Bake the cookies 10 to 14 minutes, or until the dough is set and cooked through. Remove from the oven and let stand at least 2 minutes before serving.</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
